<p><strong><em>Significance</em></strong></p>
<p>The piezoelectric nanopositioning stage is a crucial scanning device aimed at operating with nanometer or subnanometer precision. It has the advantages of high stiffness and fast response through employing piezoelectric actuators, especially in the application of scanning probe microscopes (SPMs). The raster scanning is the mostly used for the simple image reconstruction. However, Due to the indigenous lightly damped resonant dynamics, the frequency of the triangular wave in raster signal is typically restricted within 1% to 10% of the first resonance of these stages. Alternatively, the scan speed can be increased by implementing non-raster patterns such as Lissajous, cycloid, and spiral methods based on the harmonic waveform at the expense of complex imaging processing in SPMs. However, the tracking errors with these methods still increase with the varying amplitude so that the scanning performance is significantly deteriorated.</p>
<p><strong><em>My Contributions</em></strong></p>
<p>(a) For the motion tracking of triangular waves in raster scanning, although the feedforward iterative learning control(ILC) is an effect control method, the fixed bandwidth of Q filter in traditional ILC limits the high-bandwidth tracking. Therefore, a linear time-varying Q-filter based iterative learning control is proposed. With the discrete wavelet transform of position errors, the time-varying bandwidth profile is generated based on the modulus maximum of wavelet detail coefficients. Then, through establishing the projection between references and finite-time response basic function, the error convergence for varying reference during iteration is achieved so that the applications of iterative learning control are extended.</p>
<p>(b) For the flexure-hinge-guided piezoelectric-actuated system, a novel signal-transformation based repetitive controller is proposed. Through developing a mapping between the signals and constant amplitude sinusoidal and combining repetitive control, the controller can provide multiple lower gains at the fundamental frequency and its harmonics so as to ensure zero steady-state errors. The proposed method overcomes the requirement of strictly periodic references or disturbances of conventional repetitive controller. The stability of the control method and convergence of steady-state errors are analyzed with a lifted-system representation respectively for its time-variant property.</p>

<p><strong><em>Significance</em></strong></p>
<p>The indigenous hysteresis nonlinearity and lightly damped vibrational modes of piezoelectric nanopositioning stage degrade motion performance seriously. On one hand, for the commonly used repetitive trajectory in motion systems, the iterative learning control (ILC) method is still quite sensitive to non-repetitive disturbance, although it can eliminate repetitive errors effectively via iterations. On the other hand, repetitive control cannot improve the ability to suppress nonperiodic disturbance and model uncertainties, which are common in piezoelectric nanopositioning stages stemmed by hysteresis, sensor noise, mechanical shocks, or external environment, and the error at nonperiodic frequency is amplified because of waterbed effect.</p>
<p><strong><em>My Contributions</em></strong></p>
<p>(a) In order to achieve precision motion with non-repetitive disturbance for piezoelectric micro-positioning stages, a control strategy integrating ILC with disturbance observer (DOB) is proposed. Firstly, the hysteresis nonlinearity is treated as repetitive input disturbance during the iterative process to avoid complex hysteresis modeling. Then, to ensure the stability of the proposed strategy, the convergence condition is deduced and the suppression of non-repetitive disturbance is analyzed to minimize convergence error.</p>
<p>(b) In order to achieve high-speed and precision motion, a new composite control scheme by integrating RC with disturbance observer (DOB) is developed. To simplify controller implementation, the hysteresis nonlinearity is treated as external disturbance and the proposed method is designed in frequency domain. The stability and robust stability are analyzed, and an optimization procedure to calculate the controller parameters is employed to enhance the performance to the maximum extent.</p>
<p>(c) A new control scheme of model-assisted extended state observer based RC is developed, where MESO is utilized to estimate as well as compensate disturbances and the estimated state variables are also used to design state feedback based RC for a non-minimum phase (NMP) system with disturbances.</p>

<p><strong><em>Significance</em></strong></p>
<p>A piezoelectric actuator based ear surgical device, named Ventilation Tube Applicator (VTA) has been developed to help surgeons to conduct the surgical treatment of myringotomy with tube insertion after the first treatment using medication fails. Accurate tracking of the interaction force between the piezoelectric-actuated system and the affected human tissues is an important aspect to improve safety and surgery success rate. Moreover, the myringotomy and grommet insertion during the surgical operation requires the high-precision position tracking.</p>
<p><strong><em>My Contributions</em></strong></p>
<p>(a) For the contact phase of myringotomy with tube insertion, an adaptive integral terminal sliding mode force control scheme is presented to achieve precision force tracking when in contact with soft tympanic membrane. An integral terminal sliding manifold based on force error is employed to guarantee the force trajectory tracking with a finite-time convergence. Furthermore, an adaptive control law is also deployed to estimate the controller’s parameters and update the switching gain to accommodate the system uncertainty (unknown parameters), disturbances, and complex contact environment, and alleviate chattering phenomenon. The stability of the proposed control scheme is analyzed theoretically utilizing methods based upon the Lyapunov theory.</p>
<p>(b) A robust adaptive integral backstepping control is formulated to retain high position tracking precision. The second-order auxiliary differential equations based on the integral terminal sliding-mode surface are constructed to obtain the property of finite-time convergence and high-order sliding-mode control-like performance. Through employing integral backstepping methodology, the robustness to external disturbance is guaranteed. The robust stability is proven by the Lyapunov theory.</p>

<p>Interaction with the environment plays a significant role for proper and successful completion of various specific tasks for real-world robotic systems, such as for robot-assisted surgical systems in contact with human tissues. However, this required suitably soft-contact interaction brings great challenges on the force and position control because of the nonlinear, viscoelastic and inhomogeneous contact environment. Therefore, the complete overall control objective is to regulate the force and position at the same time during the operating process for a soft interaction; and retain robustness to the possibly adverse impacts arising from imperfections such as friction, hysteresis, and model uncertainties.</p>
<p><strong><em>My Contributions</em></strong></p>
<p>(a) The steady-state performance of the desired impedance model when in contact with soft tissues described by the nonlinear Hunt-Crossley(HC) nonlinear model is derived and analyzed to evaluate the steady-state position and force errors, and to facilitate parameter selection for soft interaction.</p>
<p>(b) An integral terminal sliding manifold based on the auxiliary variable containing impedance error is developed to achieve finite-time convergence and improve tracking performance. Moreover, an adaptive law is also augmented to update the upper bound of the total disturbance to guarantee the robustness to undesired impacts.</p></div>
